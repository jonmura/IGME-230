# Nightmare Runner

![The Nightmare Runner Logo][logo]

You don't remember going to bed, but what other explanation is there? Between the technicolor sky, the broken landscape, and whatever that... *thing* behind you is, there's no way any of this was real. All you know is that whatever the swirly black thing touches just stops... being. Its gone. Pinching yourself awake didn't help and you really don't want to find out what exactly it did with everything it snagged, so your only choice is to run. Let's just hope you can evade it long enough to get a good night's sleep.

# Proposal
___

# Nightmare Runner

## Concept

Nightmare Runner is a 2D sidescrolling infinite runner where you play as a sleeping college student who finds himself in a recurring dream where he keeps running from a giant, world destroying entity.

## Genre

Nightmare Runner will be a typical infinite runner game.

## Platform

Nightmare Runner will be made primarily for desktop, but will likely be mobile-friendly.

## Story

The main character, Joe Runnerman, is your average college student who wants nothing more than to get a good night's rest. Unfortunately for him, he falls asleep one night to find himself being chased by a dark, world eating entity. Unable to pinch himself awake, he must now run, jump, and slide his way through a dangerous dreamscape to keep himself alive.

Other than the main premise above, the game has no real plot. The player's motivation for playing will be to try and get further/ get a higher score raterh than to complete objectives.

## Asthetics

The art-style is currently planned to look somewhat abstract, adding to the overall dream-like feel of the game.

Sound-wise, there'll primarily be various movement-based sound effects, with a loooping track in the background.

## Gameplay

### Mechanics

#### 1. Avoidance

The player must keep avoiding obstacles in order to avoid ending the level.

#### 2. Endless Game

Procedural generation of levels provides for infinte level possibilities, while stripping the game down to basic mechanics. If the player doesn't need to focus on how the developer designed the level, then they can focus solely on gameplay.

#### 3. Fun Once, Fun Always

Because of the simple nature of the game, players can pick it up whenever they want to have some fun.

#### 4. Progression Dynamic

By collecting "energy" this game's version of currency, the player can upgrade certain abilities, making thme feel as though they're progressing further.

#### 5. Status

Potential arcade-style leaderboard implementation.

### Control

On desktop, the player will be able to control the character by pressing either up or w to jump, and either s or down to slide. Additionally, if powerups are added, the spacebar will be used to activate them.

### Teaching the game

In order to teach players how to play, each level will start off with a premade set of all possible hurdles - an obstacle to jump over, an obstacle to slide under, and a pit to jump over - in order to show the player what's what.

### Player Learning

In order to get a higher score in the game, the player will have to learn how to combine their two main actions - jumping and sliding - in such a way that they can avoid all obstacles. Additionally, they'll have to commit it to muscle memory, as this will become more difficult as the game speeds up and throws variations of obstacles at the player.

## Process

In designing the site, I had two things in mind, simplicity, and acessibility. For simplicity, I wanted to prevent the site from having a very busy look. As such, I limited the number of colors in the palette, and by using relatively little style rules in the css, but using rules that would maxamize the appearance of the page. For accessibility, I wanted the user to be able to navigate and read the site without any issues. I did this by using relatively large text, and working on a navbar that was easy to understand, with the page you're currently on highlighted so that there's no way the user could feel lost.

The biggest challenge in designing the site was getting the footer to go to the bottom of the page, and then figuring out how to get the rest of the page to come down. In the end, I was able to get the footer to move after finding a tutorial, but the main section of the pages looked weird going all the way to the bottom, so I decided to remove the code and add some padding so that there was some space between the main div and the footer.

## Resources

All images were made by me.
