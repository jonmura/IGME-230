# Nightmare Runner

## Concept

Nightmare Runner is a 2D sidescrolling infinite runner where you play as a sleeping college student who finds himself in a recurring dream where he keeps running from a giant, world destroying entity.

## Genre

Nightmare Runner will be a typical infinite runner game

## Platform

Nightmare Runner will be made primarily for desktop, but will likely be mobile-friendly

## Story

The main character, Joe Runnerman, is your average college student who wants nothing more than to get a good night's rest. Unfortunately for him, he falls asleep one night to find himself being chased by a dark, world eating entity. Unable to pinch himself awake, he must now run, jump, and slide his way through a dangerous dreamscape to keep himself alive.

Other than the main premise above, the game has no real plot. The player's motivation for playing will be to try and get further/ get a higher score raterh than to complete objectives.

## Asthetics

The art-style is currently planned to look somewhat abstract, adding to the overall dream-like feel of the game.

Sound-wise, there'll primarily be various movement-based sound effects, with a loooping track in the background.

## Gameplay

### Mechanics



### Control

On desktop, the player will be able to control the character by pressing either up or w to jump, and either s or down to slide. Additionally, if powerups are added, the spacebar will be used to activate them.

### Teaching the game

In order to teach players how to play, each level will start off with a premade set of all possible hurdles - an obstacle to jump over, an obstacle to slide under, and a pit to jump over - in order to show the player what's what.

### Player Learning

In order to get a higher score in the game, the player will have to learn how to combine their two main actions - jumping and sliding - in such a way that they can avoid all obstacles. Additionally, they'll have to commit it to muscle memory, as this will become more difficult as the game speeds up and throws variations of obstacles at the player.
